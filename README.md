Unit 03 JavaScript Homework: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.

The application asks the user for a password length between 8 and 128, and offers 4 different character sets that the user can combine in creating their password. 

This is done by pulling values from user input, sanitizing those values, then running a for loop that appends the proper characters to a string. The password is then changed from an array to a clean string, and passed back using innerHTML, at the same time changing the div from display: none to inline-block. Generating a new password follows the same basic flow, after clearing the array that holds the password.

The application has a clean user interface and is responsive
